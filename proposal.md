# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of my project is "Cat and Mouse" 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a maze game similar to Pacman where there is a mouse that goes around the maze collecting cheese and there are multiple cats chasing after the mouse. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will be a interactive maze game where the player controls the mouse to go around the maze collecting cheeze. The maze will have cats roaming around, and mouse will have to move around to avoid them. The goal of the game is to collect all the cheese and exit the maze. If the mouse gets caught by one of the cats, the games ends. The features of the game would be counter for the amount of cheese collected and possible power ups for the mouse to speed up. The project will executed through python with pygame. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be a maze game where the player can control the mouse around the maze and collect the cheese while avoiding the cats. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for the final project would be a playable maze game with moving mouse collecting cheese while avoiding cats, and score counter for amount of cheese collected. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is playable maze game with moving mouse collecting while avoiding cats. For every cheese collected, a score counter will be updated. With every 10th cheese collected, the mouse gets power up of speeding up.  

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps would be to download pygame and research tutorials for building pacman game in python.
